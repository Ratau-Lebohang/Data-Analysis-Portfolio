# About Me

Hi! I'm Lebohang, a recent graduate with a diploma in IT Management and a strong passion for data analytics, IT support, and database management. I'm currently enhancing my skills in SQL, Excel, and data visualization while building projects that showcase my analytical abilities.

My free time is dedicated to continuous learning in data analysis, where I actively seek out new tools and techniques to deepen my understanding and problem-solving abilities. 

I have completed the Google Data Analytics Certification and am working towards the Google IT Support Certification to strengthen my technical expertise. My portfolio includes hands-on projects in data cleaning, preparation, and visualization, using tools like BigQuery, Tableau, and Excel dashboards.

I use this repository to share my work and to document my learning journey.

**Description:** For this personal project, I dove into a raw dataset of street food vendors from around the globe. I started by cleaning and transforming the data in Excel, then used BigQuery to write SQL codes that helped uncover interesting patterns and trends. Finally, I brought the data to life by creating interactive dashboards in Tableau. This project was all about testing my skills and boosting my CV with hands-on experience.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data transformation, Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization

**Technology:** SQL (BigQuery), Tableau/Power BI, Excel

**Results:** This project analyzed a global dataset of popular street foods, revealing key trends in regional popularity, ingredient usage, nutritional content, and preparation. I also included the SQL code used and Dashboards in the analysis so anyone can follow along.

**Goal:** To analyze global food wastage data and uncover insights regarding waste distribution by country, food category, and economic impact.

**Description:** This project leveraged a comprehensive Kaggle dataset containing records of food waste amounts, categorized by country, food type, and household-level data. Key steps included data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize trends and quantify economic losses over time.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, pivot table creation, dashboard development, trend analysis.

**Technology:** Microsoft Excel.

**Results:** The project produced actionable insights such as identifying high-waste regions, revealing the most wasted food categories, and detailing economic losses by year.
